# My personal blog
Build with static pages generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). <br>
I made theme on my own. <br>
Main role of this blog is help me with learning new skills - in posts I write about programming (especially in Ruby) and also try to get better in front-end,
changing layout and style of this site.
