My name is Joanna and I decided to start learning Ruby, because it is a begginer-friendly language and you can make a lot of different web applications using it.<br>


<h2>My skills:</h2>
Ruby <br>
Ruby on Rails <br>
HTML 5 <br>
CSS 3 <br>
Bootstrap 4 <br>
JavaScript <br>
Git <br>
macOS <br>

I am a beginner, but I am still learning :)
