I am working on application where will be many users and everybody can sign up. In this case security is very important thing. I installed gem [Devise][devise], flexible authentication solution for Rails, which is recommended by professional and experienced developers. Many applications use it, but for me it is something new.

If you are a beginner, it is not a good idea to use solutions like this. You should do an authentication in your first application on your own. Of course, it probably won't be completely safe, but will help you understand mechanism of this process.
