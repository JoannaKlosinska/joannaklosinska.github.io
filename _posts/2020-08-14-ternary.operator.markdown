It is good to remember to make your codes shorter. When you working on big application, where there so many files and lines of codes in them, it is very important. Start to do it during your learning so you will have good habits in your future.<br>One of the ways to make your code shorter, it's <strong>ternary operator</strong>. You can use it in else/if statements. Here you have structure of it: 

{% highlight ruby %}
if boolean?
	do_something
else
	do_something_else
end

Means exactly the same as:

boolean ? do_something : do_something_else

Or easier: 

condition ? True : false
{% endhighlight %}

I will give you also a practical example:

{% highlight ruby %}
flower_price = 50

if flower_price < 100
  puts "Let's buy flowers!"
else
 puts "Don't buy flowers today :("
end

Instead of this, you can write just:

puts flower_price < 100? "Let's buy flowers!" : "Don't buy flowers today :("
{% endhighlight %}
