I started my learning with <b>[Codecademy][codecademy]</b> tutorials. When I decided to learn Ruby language, that was my first course which I did on this site. In my opinion this is very good way to start, because you can learn from very beginning about the basics of specific language in nice, interactive platform. In Codecademy you have a lot of free tutorials, but if you want to learn more about something, you can pay for pro account.

Next, I did HTML and CSS courses. It is important to know at least the basics from these languages.

After that I started my adventure with <b>[Ruby on Rails Tutorial][ruby-on-rails-tutorial]</b> from Michael Hartl. This book is like a bible for beginner Ruby developer :) It takes time to do everything from this tutorial, but it's worth it. When you finish this book, you have complete and working application.

Now I am trying to create working application on my own. It is also very good kind of learning for me. Of course I don't know everything now, so sometimes I need to googling answers for my questions, watching tutorials on YouTube or asking experienced developers.

I have a plan to write on this blog every new thing I learn :)
